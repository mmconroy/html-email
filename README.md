Coding in HTML is different from web coding in that all styling will be done in-line and not through a separate style sheet.

Coders can use tables and in-line styling to work around the limitations of not being able to use a style sheet with HTML emails. Tables can effectively work at your different divs to allow for container styling done in-line.
